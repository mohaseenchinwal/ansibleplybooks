#       WhoIs Check Daemon 16.0.0-29945
#       Registry System Version 16.0.0
#
# Configuration File
#
# This file contains all the configurable options that are avaliable for the
# whois check daemon. Some of these options can be overridden with command line
# options, for more information on those please run whoischeckd --help on the
# command line.
#
# General Syntax:
#
# The general format of this file is a set of key-value pairs. Typically in
# the form:
#
# key = value
#
# arbitrary whitespace is allowed. The hash character can be used for comments
# a has can appear anywhere on a line and will cause the rest of the line to be
# ignored. Single word string values do not have to be quoted, however multi-
# word string values should be quoted. The exception to this is if a string
# value contains a '#' or an '=' then the value must be quoted regardless.
# In quoted values standard escape characters can be used such as \n etc. As
# with C programs multiple quoted strings will be concatenated to form one
# string. This can be used to split large quoted values over several lines.
#
# Eg. All of the below are acceptable in the configuration file
#
# key=value
#
# key   =       value   #ending comment
#
# key=
#       value
# key=  #embedded comment
#       value
# key   =       "quoted value"
#
# key=
# "multiline\n"
# "quoted\n"
# "value"
#
# etc...

#
# :: Network Options ::
#
# IPv4 Bind Address:
#
# This allows you to configure the interface on which the daemon should
# listen for incoming connections. Specify the IPv4 address of the interface
# that you want the daemon to bind to. If you want the daemon to listen on all
# IPv4 addresses set this value to "*".
#
# bind-address = "IP ADDRESS"
#
# Eg. to listen on the loopback interface: bind-address = "127.0.0.1"
#
# THERE IS NO DEFAULT FOR THIS OPTION, YOU MUST DEFINE IT FOR THE DAEMON TO
# LISTEN ON AN IPv4 ADDRESS
#
#
#bind-address=

# IPv6 Bind Address:
#
# This allows you to configure the interface on which the daemon should
# listen for incoming connections. Specify the IPv6 address of the interface
# that you want the daemon to bind to. If you want the daemon to listen on all
# IPv6 addresses set this value to "*".
#
# bind-address-ipv6 = "IP ADDRESS"
#
# Eg. to listen on the loopback interface: bind-address-ipv6 = "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1"
#
# THERE IS NO DEFAULT FOR THIS OPTION, YOU MUST DEFINE IT FOR THE DAEMON TO
# LISTEN ON AN IPv6 ADDRESS
#
#
#bind-address-ipv6=

#
# Bind Port:
#
# This allows you to configure the port to which the daemon should bind to
# listen for incoming TCP connections. Specify the port number of the port you
# want the daemon to bind to. Remeber that to bind to ports < 1024 the process
# must be running with root permissions.
#
# bind-port = PORT NUMBER
#
# Eg. to bind to port 1700: bind-port = 1700
#
# The default is 43
#
#
#bind-port=43

#
# Socket Idle Timeout:
#
# This value allows you to specify the amount of idle time allowed on a socket
# before the server will assume the client is dead and terminate the
# connection. Don't set this value too large or it could potentially be used
# to perform a denial of service attache on the system. For protocols like
# whois and whois check a resonable value is 10 seconds, for trusted protocols
# like epp a larger value of around 10 mins is more appropriate. The value is
# specified in milliseconds.
#
# socket-idle-timeout = TIMEOUT IN MS
#
# Eg. to set the timeout to 1 min: socket-idle-timeout = 60000
#
# The default is 10000
#
#
#socket-idle-timeout=10000

#
# :: Logging Options ::
#
# Transaction Log:
#
# This option is the path and file name of the file that you wish the
# daemon to log transactions to.
#
# transaction-log = "PATH/FILENAME"
#
# Eg. to log to a file called 'tx.log' in /var: transaction-log = "/var/tx.log"
#
# The default is "/var/log/registryd/whoischeckd.txlog"
#
#
#transaction-log="/var/log/registryd/whoischeckd.txlog"

#
# Application Log:
#
# This option is the path and file name of the file that you wish the
# daemon to log the application messages (including errors) to. This is also
# the log were debugging messages will be logged when turned on.
#
# application-log = "PATH/FILENAME"
#
# Eg. to log to a file called 'ap.log' in /var: application-log = "/var/ap.log"
#
# The default is "/var/log/registryd/whoischeckd.log"
#
#
#application-log="/var/log/registryd/whoischeckd.log"

#
# Application Log Level:
#
# This option specifies the log level that the daemon will use when logging
# to the application log. The higher the log level, the less information that
# will be logged to the application log file. This value can be changed when
# the daemon is running by using the 'arctl' utility. The highest logging
# level is LOG_EMERGENCY and the lowest is LOG_DEBUG.
#
# application-log-level = [LOG_EMERGENCY | LOG_ALERT | LOG_CRITICAL |
#                          LOG_ERROR | LOG_WARNING | LOG_NOTICE |
#                          LOG_INFO | LOG_DEBUG]
#
# Eg. to set the log level to WARNINGs: application-log-level = LOG_WARNING
#
# The default is LOG_INFO
#
#
#application-log-level=LOG_INFO

#
# :: Databse Options ::
#

#
# Database Username:
#
# This option specifies the username that is to be used to connect to the
# registry database.
#
# db-username = USERNAME
#
# Eg. to set the username to 'dbuser': db-username = dbuser
#
# THERE IS NO DEFAULT FOR THIS OPTION YOU MUST DEFINE IT
#
#
#db-username=

#
# Database Password:
#
# This option specifies the password that is to be used to connect to the
# registry database.
#
# db-password = PASSWORD
#
# Eg. to set the password to 'dbpass': db-password = dbpass
#
# THERE IS NO DEFAULT FOR THIS OPTION YOU MUST DEFINE IT
#
#
#db-password=

#
# Database URI:
#
# This option specifies the database connection string that is to be used to
# connect to the registry database. It accepts a string that is in any format
# the oracle client will interpret. The prefered format is shown in the syntax
# below. The DBHOST can be an IP address or a host name.
#
# db-uri = DBHOST:DBPORT/DBSID
#
# Eg. to use database host db1 on standard TNS port with database sid regdb:
#       db-uri = db1:1521/regdb
#
# THERE IS NO DEFAULT FOR THIS OPTION YOU MUST DEFINE IT
#
#
#db-uri=

#
# Database Connections:
#
# This options specifies the number of database connections that the daemon is
# to open to the database. This directly affects the number of simlutaneous
# transactions that the system can process. However maximum through-put with
# lowest latency is maintained by keeping this value small.
#
# db-connections = INTEGER
#
# Eg. to set the number of connections to 5: db-connections = 5
#

#
# The default is 5
#
#
#db-connections=5

#
# :: General Options ::
#
# Error Response:
#
# This option specifies the default error response to return to client as a
# last resort when the registry database cannot be service connections (or
# is returning erroneous results).
#
# error-repsonse = "STRING"
#
# Eg. to set the response to 'SYSTEM ERROR': error-response = "SYSTEM ERROR"
#
# The default is "Temporary internal failure. Please try again later..."
#
#
#error-response="Temporary internal failure. Please try again later..."

#
# PID File:
#
# This option is the path and name of a file which the pid of the running
# daemon is to be stored in. Each running instance of the daemon requires
# its own pid file. The command line parameter can be used to help running
# multiple daemons.
#
# pid-file = "PATH/FILE"
#
# Eg. to use the file 'daemon.pid' in /run: pid-file = "/run/daemon.pid"
#
# The default is "/var/run/registryd/whoischeckd.pid"
#
#
#pid-file="/var/run/registryd/whoischeckd.pid"

#
# Lock File:
#
# This option is the path and name of a file which the running daemon will
# call flock on. Each running instance of the daemon requires its own lock
# file. The command line parameter can be used to help running multiple
# daemons.
#
# lock-file = "PATH/FILE"
#
# Eg. to use the file 'daemon.lock' in /run: lock-file = "/run/daemon.lock"
#
# The default is "/var/run/registryd/whoischeckd.lock"
#
#
#lock-file="/var/run/registryd/whoischeckd.lock"

#
# Run As User:
# This option specifies the username of the user that the daemon should switch
# to after starting. The daemon must be started with root priviliges to change
# the effective user id. If the daemon has been requested to bind to a low
# port (bind-port < 1024) then the daemon will NOT switch user until it has
# bound to the port. To not change user at all set this value to the empty
# string ("")
#
# runas-user = "USERNAME"
#
# Eg. to specify the username as reguser: runas-user = "reguser"
#
# The default is ""
#
#
#runas-user=""

#==============================================================================
#
# WARNING: You shouldn't need to edit anything further down below. These
#          parameters adjust the internal workings of the registry daemon.
#          Please DO NOT set/change any of these items unless you are
#          sure you know what you are doing or have been instructed to
#          do so by AusRegistry technical support.
#
#==============================================================================
#
# :: Advanced Options ::
#
# Listening Socket Backlog:
#
# This value will contorl the amount of memory pre-allocated in the kernel
# buffers for temporarily holding the connections until the daemon is able
# to service (accept) them. This value is directly passed to the 'listen'
# function. Please DO NOT change this value unless you are sure you know what
# you are doing.
#
# listening-socket-backlog = INTEGER
#
# Eg. to set the backlog size to 2500: listening-socket-backlog = 2500
#
# The default is 1000
#
#
#listening-socket-backlog=1000

#
# Reusable Socket:
#
# This is a boolean value that determines if the SO_REUSEADDR socket options is
# to be set on the listening socket. If the value is true then the daemon can
# rebind to the socket even when there are previous clients still in the
# FIN_WAIT state.
#
# resuseable-socket = [true|false]
#
# Eg. to use the reusable socket option: resuseable-socket = true
#
# The default is true

#
#reusable-socket=true

#
# Diable Nagle:
#
# This is a boolean value that determines if the TCP_NOWAIT socket option is
# to be set on the listening AND all client sockets. If the value is true then
# the daemon will not use the nagle algoritium when communicating with clients
# if you are having problems with clients using older TCP stacks try disabling
# this option.
#
# diable-nagle = [true|false]
#
# Eg. to keep nagle enabled: disable-nagle = false
#
# The default is true
#
#
#disable-nagle=true

#
# Use Keepalives:
#
# This is a boolean value that determines if the TCP_KEEPALIVE socket option
# is to be set on the listening AND all client sockets. If the value is true
# then the daemon will periodically send tcp keep-alive packets to the client
# to verify they are still there. This is espiecially useful when there is a
# large timeout value in use. If you find that TCP sockets are are hanging
# around in the connection table for seemingly forever then you can try
# enabling this option.
#
# use-keepalives = [true|false]
#
# Eg. to enable keepalives: use-keepalives = true
#
# The default is true
#
#
#use-keepalives =true

#
# Epoll Options:
#
# These options control the way in which the daemon uses the epoll edge
# triggered event notification interface of the linux kernel.
#
# epoll-thread = INTEGER        #currently ignored
# epoll-timeout = TIMEOUT MS
# epoll-size = INTEGER
#
# Eg. to set the number of thread to 2, timeout to 10 seconds and size to 100:
#     epoll-thread = 2
#     epoll-timeout = 10000
#     epoll-size = 100
#
# The defaults are:
#     epoll-thread: 1
#     epoll-timeout: 10000
#     epoll-size: 1000
#
#
#epoll-threads=1
#epoll-timeout=10000
#epoll-size=1000
